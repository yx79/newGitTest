When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    after finish several commits and ready to upload

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because some change and commits may have error or not finished.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    clone is to copy entire repository from github to local or local to local, anywhere
        to work locally
    fork is to copy entire repository from github to another github location
    git branch will create a new branch, the new changes in new branch can help 
        keep reference to previous version and benefits collaborators.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
